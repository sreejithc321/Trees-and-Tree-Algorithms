## Tree

A tree consists of a set of nodes and a set of edges that connect pairs of nodes. A tree has the following properties:
- One node of the tree is designated as the root node.
- Every node n, except the root node, is connected by an edge from exactly one other node p, where p is the parent of n.
- A unique path traverses from the root to each node.

## Binary Tree

If each node in the tree has a maximum of two children, we say that the tree is a binary tree.
